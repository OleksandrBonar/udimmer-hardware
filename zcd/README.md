# Zero Cross Detector

## Features
 - highly accurate mains zero crossing detection
 - fully isolated and low voltage safe output
 - ultra-low power consumption; worst case power dissipation < 120mW
 - produces symmetrical pulses around zero crossings
 - output pulse stays constant, independent of the mains voltage
 - very low parts count, no precision components required
 - all components can be low voltage SMD
 - works over all voltage ranges (100VAC/240VAC), without modification
 - 50Hz/60Hz compatible
 - 50Hz produces a 1ms ZC pulse, 60Hz produces 0.83ms ZC pulse
 - highly stable with varying temperature and aging
